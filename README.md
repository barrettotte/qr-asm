# qr-xslt

Generate a QR code SVG with only XSLT. I really don't know why I made this.

The "interesting" XSLT source is located in [src/main/resources/xslt/](src/main/resources/xslt/).

The example java project included generates a PDF with a list of a GitHub user's repositories
and a generated QR code to link to their profile.
